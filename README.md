# 🎵 Raylib Soundboard (Python)

A simple, customizable **soundboard application** built entirely in **Python using raylib**.

> ⚠️ **Work in Progress**  
> Core soundboard functionality is still under development.  
> The **UI kit is nearly complete** and serves as the foundation for the final application.

---
> ⚠️ NOTE : 
> THERE ARE GONNA BE TWO VERSION OF THIS PYTHON APP, one for the terminal
> other for the GUI, however both may share the same functionality. For prototyping purposes Terminal version will be updated more frequently than GUI (GUI COMPONENTS TAKE MORE TIME TO BE RESOLVED AND DESIGNED)

## 🖼️ UI Kit Status

The UI system is almost finished and includes:
- Button components
- Layout management
- Visual theming
- Input handling

This UI kit will be reused for the full soundboard experience once audio logic is finalized.
